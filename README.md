# *New project* generation script

This script has one goal : automatically generate all the *side*-files necessary to perform a good and relevant version control over the project's lifespan.

Execute `sh new.sh` and the script will automatically deal with:

- `LICENSE`, `AUTHORS`, `README`
- `.gitignore` with the most common assets to exclude
- Local Git repo creation and connection to remote one



**Note**: Open to contributions to improve the tool in order to minimize the developement time dedicated to the useful but time-wasting steps.
